Without a strong criteria on what's the stock levels, lack of expiration dates, use and stock quantities, etc challenges not only production but jeopardize the production goal, potential downtime which translate in economical loses and unsatisfaction to Customers, and also very likely high unit prices that could be renegotiated.
